# C-M-cleaning-and-maid-service
This is an online booking and employee management system, a university project I did for one of the modules in my final year using HTML, CSS, PHP, Ajax, Javascript and MySQL. 

**C&M** is a cleaning and maid service company located in Yangon, Myanmar. Recently, online 
booking system has become popular in Myanmar and many companies and businesses have 
started developing their own websites and applications for online booking. Therefore, C&M 
company wants to change the company processes to computerised system such as house
cleaner management system which auto assigns the house cleaners to the cleaning 
appointments and also wants to have a website where customers can easily book and contact 
the company.

The developed system will be used by four types of users, namely
* Manager
* Administrator
* Employee (House cleaner)
* Customer/ Client
